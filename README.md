### CSL 332 NETWORK LAB EXPERIMENTS

1. [***Multi-User Chat Server using TCP***](https://github.com/Ashil10/Network_Lab/tree/main/1%29Multi%20user%20chat%20TCP
)
   - Build a chat server using TCP to allow multiple users to communicate simultaneously.

2. [***Concurrent Time Server using UDP***](https://github.com/Ashil10/Network_Lab/tree/main/2%29Concurrent%20Time%20Server%20UDP)
   - Develop a time server using UDP that serves multiple client requests concurrently.

3. [***Distance Vector Routing***](https://github.com/Ashil10/Network_Lab/tree/main/3%29Distance%20Vector%20Routing)
   - Study routing algorithms where routers exchange information based on distance to destinations.

4. [***Stop and Wait ARQ Protocol***](https://github.com/Ashil10/Network_Lab/tree/main/4%29Stop%20and%20Wait%20ARQ%20Protocol)
   - Implement a protocol ensuring reliable data transmission by acknowledging each packet sent.

5. [***Go Back N ARQ Protocol***](https://github.com/Ashil10/Network_Lab/tree/main/5%29Go-Back-N%20ARQ%20Protocol)
   - Implement a protocol enabling reliable data transmission with sliding windows for efficient error recovery.

6. [***Concurrent File System***](https://github.com/Ashil10/Network_Lab/tree/main/6%29Concurrent%20File%20System)
   - Implement a server-client architecture where the server concurrently reads a text file upon client request and sends the response back to the client.

7. [***Leaky Bucket Congestion Control***](https://github.com/Ashil10/Network_Lab/tree/main/7%29Leaky%20Bucket%20Congestion%20Control)
   - Implement the Leaky Bucket Algorithm to control network congestion by regulating data flow through a constant outflow rate from a buffer.
